# VetYouHome
https://vetyouhome.online

A health care system web app which focuses on improving pet record and order work experience for vets and animal hospital.



The main idea of this project is from clinical vets needs.
For the last 10 years, some animal hostpital still use old-fasion UI with low resolution application and bad UX for pet record/order work. That system was not well designed for modern/digital workflow which causes low work efficiency for clinical vets.
In veterinary practice, vets should have a more convenient application to speed up their routine work.

## Pain Points And Solution
> All the pain points are proposed and discussed by clinical vets and the author through needs interview
1. Vets are hard to trace a pet's hitorical records and their corresponding orders which are split saved in differenct databases(not related).
    - ***Store records and orders in related database and double views for inspecting hitorical records/orders.***
2. Vets make exam/medication/treatment reocrds with no name hint which means they have to remember what services the hospital supplies and even typo easily.
    - ***Text autocomplete from existing services.***
3. Vets input similar orders again and again.
    - ***Rapid add-in from historical orders.***
